Umple case study implementing an autonomous rover

This repository is to record progress towards the challenge problem posed by the MDETools workshop at https://mdetools.github.io/mdetools18/challengeproblem.html Please consult that site for full details about running the simulation.

In short: This repo creates an autonomous rover that can follow a leader.

A paper was accepted: Lethbridge, T.C., and Algablan, A., "Applying Umple to the rover control challenge problem: A case study in model-driven engineering", MDETools 2018, Copenhagen, CEUR 2245

Following the workshop the following page was created to list all the solutions: https://mdetools.github.io/mdetools18/challangemain.html

Tags associated with releases are being created to allow readers to understand the agile process that was
followed to create various versions of this system.
